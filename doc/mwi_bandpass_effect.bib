	abstract = {Abstract. Several recent studies have observed systematic differences between measurements in the 183.31 GHz water vapor line by space-borne sounders and calculations using radiative transfer models, with inputs from either radiosondes (radiosonde observations, RAOBs) or short-range forecasts by numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper discusses all the relevant categories of observation-based or model-based data, quantifies their uncertainties and separates biases that could be common to all causes from those attributable to a particular cause. Reference observations from radiosondes, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and Raman lidar are thus overviewed. Biases arising from their calibration procedures, NWP models and data assimilation, instrument biases and radiative transfer models (both the models themselves and the underlying spectroscopy) are presented and discussed. Although presently no single process in the comparisons seems capable of explaining the observed structure of bias, recommendations are made in order to better understand the causes.},

	abstract = {Forward models are a key tool to generate synthetic observations given knowledge of the atmospheric state. In this way, they are an integral part of inversion algorithms that aim to retrieve geophysical variables from observations or in data assimilation. Their application for the exploitation of the full information content of remote sensing observations becomes increasingly important when these are used to evaluate the performance of cloud-resolving models (CRMs). Herein, CRM proﬁles or ﬁelds provide the input to the forward model whose simulation results are subsequently compared to the observations. This paper introduces the freely available comprehensive microwave forward model PAMTRA (Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer), demonstrates its capabilities to simulate passive and active measurements across the microwave spectral region for upward- and downward-looking geometries, and illustrates how the forward simulations can be used to evaluate CRMs and to interpret measurements to improve our understanding of cloud processes.},

	abstract = {Since several decades, microwave radiometers
have been an essential component of the satel-
lite observation system, enabling the retrieval
of a multitude of parameters. Conical scanning
imagers are mainly dedicated to deriving charac-
teristics of the Earth’s surface, e.g., soil moisture,
sea-surface temperature, salinity, and sea ice.
For this purpose, they make use of channels at
low frequencies where the atmosphere is rela-
tively transparent. By exploiting the differential
absorption along pressure-broadened rotational
lines, coarse resolution vertical profiles of water
vapor and temperature can be derived from mi-
crowave sounders observing along the wings of
atmospheric absorption lines. Furthermore, clouds
and precipitation produce distinct spectral signa-
tures in the microwave region, which can be best
used over ocean surfaces that have a lower sur-
face emissivity than land. Due to the rather long
wavelengths, the spatial resolution of microwave
satellite instruments is relatively poor, of the or-
der of 10 km or more. By deploying microwave
radiometers onboard aircrafts, much finer reso-
lution can be achieved, which allows dedicated
process studies. Microwave instruments flown on
several polar orbiting satellites are an essential
ingredient into today’s numerical weather pre-
diction, and their measurements are assimilated
directly as radiances by several meteorological ser-
vices worldwide. With measurements having been
available for more than three decades, microwave
observations are starting to play an important role 
in monitoring and understanding the effects of
climate change, such as the melting of the po-
lar ice caps. With the upcoming new generation
of satellites, the frequency range of the measure-
ments is expanded into the submillimeter range
to better capture ice clouds.},
