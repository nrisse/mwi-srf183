# Bias from the spectral response of MetOp-SG MWI 183 GHz channels
We conducted a study for 
[EUMETSAT](https://www.eumetsat.int/) 
to find out, how large the error is when neglecting the spectral response 
function of 
[MetOp-SG MWI](https://www.eumetsat.int/eps-sg-microwave-imager) 
in the radiative transfer. This
repository contains all relevant codes related to the work.
[Getting started](docs/usage.md) provides a description on how to use the 
provided code. [Reproduce results from report](docs/reproduce_plots.md) 
explains the relevant parts which were used to create the figures in the report.
