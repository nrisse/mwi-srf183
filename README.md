# MWI-SRF183
EUMETSAT's next generation of polar-orbiting 
satellites [MetOp-SG](https://www.eumetsat.int/metop-sg) will carry the 
[Microwave Imager (MWI)](https://www.eumetsat.int/eps-sg-microwave-imager),
which will provide global measurements of atmospheric water vapor and clouds.
Deriving these and other parameters of the Earth system requires accurate 
radiative transfer simulations at MWI frequencies.

This repository contains code to assess, how the spectral response function of 
MWI at the five 183 GHz channels impacts the radiative transfer. The results
are summarized in the report 
*Assessment of using the spectral responsivity of MetOp-SG's Microwave Imager (MWI) for the radiative transfer at 183 GHz* 
by N. Risse, M. Mech, and S. Crewell (2022). 

[Getting started](docs/usage.md) provides a 
description on how to use the provided code and this 
[guide](docs/reproduce_plots.md) summarizes the steps needed to reproduce 
figures presented in the report.
