# Can we neglect the spectral response of MWI 183 GHz channels?
We conducted a study for EUMETSAT to find out, how large the error is when
neglecting the spectral response function in the radiative transfer. This
repository contains all relevant codes related to the work.
[Getting started](docs/usage.md) provides a description on how to use the 
provided code. [Reproduce results from report](docs/reproduce_plots.md) 
explains the relevant parts which were used to create the figures in the report.
