The next generation of polar-orbiting satellites will carry the Microwave
Imager (MWI). MWI will provide global measurements of atmospheric properties 
such as water vapor and cloud liquid water.

This repository contains code to assess, how the spectral responsivity of MWI
at 183 GHz impacts the radiative transfer. [Getting started](docs/usage.md) 
provides a description. [Reproduce results from report](docs/reproduce_plots.md) 
explains the relevant parts which were used to create the figures in the report.
